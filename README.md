# ARGO-source-code
Some source code from the mobile app I helped develop with my team, where I've attached the files that I worked on.

ARGO: The Quest of Fleece is the multiplayer mobile game from Team Tamarillo which allows four players to explore the story of Jason and the Argonauts. The players play as different characters in this choose-your-own-adventure game, where each player's choices affect the game differently.

This repository contains only some of the files that we devleoped in our game. The files here are the scipts that were developed to create the core gameplay.

The design document for the full design of the game can be found in this repository.
